    <caption>Recipe for chocolate chip cookies</caption>
    
    <p>
        It’s taken us a while to zero in on our favorite method for making apple pie, but I think we’ve finally nailed it. This simple recipe guarantees perfectly cooked apples surrounded with a thick gently spiced sauce. There’s no need for precooking the sauce or apples and the steps to make this pie are simple, you just need a little time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel, and then cut the apples in half. Remove the cores, and then slice apple halves into thin slices, about 1/4-inch thick. Place the apple slices into a very large bowl.</li>
        <li>Scatter both sugars, salt, and spices over the apples, and then use your hands to toss them, coating the apple slices as much as possible. Set aside for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
